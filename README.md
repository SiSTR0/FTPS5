# FTPS5
FTP server for PS5 Webkit.

# Building

Run `make`. Requires GCC or Clang to be installed.

# Custom commands:

- MTRW: Remount /system and /system_ex partitions with read-write access

## Known issue
Forking webkit process causes a kernel panic when the console is shut down.

Build with `make PERSIST=0` to avoid it but persistence will be lost.
